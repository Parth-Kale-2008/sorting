In this repo we would be learning insertion sort,bubble sort and linear search

#
1. Insertion Sort
🔹 Description
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
It picks an element and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array

#
2. Bubble Sort
🔹 Description
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
After each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the correct position.

#
3. Linear Search
🔹 Description
Linear Search checks each element in the array sequentially until the target element is found.
